## Custom Carousel Generator

The Custom Carousel Generator is a web app that enables users to create and preview fully customizable image carousels, and simply copy the outputted code into their projects.

Visit the web app here: https://michaelvinci.github.io/custom-carousel-generator/

### Usage

--Enter a unique ID string for the carousel. This will be the namespace for all custom styles as well as the ID used for an empty carousel div located in the HTML where the image carousel will appear.

--Multiple carousel instances can be used in the same project as long as a unique namespace is created for each one. The static CSS is shared between instances, but uniquely namespaced CSS selectors must be included for every custom carousel.

--All source code is generated on the fly as settings are changed, so copy and paste as soon as you are satisfied with the carousel design.

--During instantiation, the Carousel class will expect an array of image objects passed in, each containing **url** and **alt** values.

**Note: The code generated by this app has not been pre-processed. For best performance and compatibility, include code prior to build process.**

Enjoy!
